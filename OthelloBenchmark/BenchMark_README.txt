There are the test results we have made against the benchmark. We include the log of the console output as a txt file for every test and screen captures of game results in the website. There are some pictures are missing by mistake.

Because we use different computer and different running type( debug or release) to do the test, so the running time may be quite different in the log. And the running time in the screen capture of website is not reliable because it includes the time we do the operation between benchmark and our AI.
